### Due Friday, March 3, 2017 - 5:00pm

The goal of this assignment is to implement a program using arrays.

##Requirements

**Part 1 (50 points):** For this question, you will implement your own version of `ArrayList`.  Your class, called `StringList`, will maintain an array of `String` objects and provide most of the functionality of the `ArrayList`. 

Download the following two java files: [StringList.java](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CS112-S17/labs/master/code/StringList.java) and [StringListTester.java](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CS112-S17/labs/master/code/StringListTester.java). [StringList.java](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CS112-S17/labs/master/code/StringList.java) provides the skeleton for the code you must implement. Complete all methods as described in the documentation. For full credit, your submission must pass all of the tests in the class [StringListTester.java](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CS112-S17/labs/master/code/StringListTester.java).

If your submission is submitted incorrectly you will receive a 0 for this assignment. You are always welcome to come to office hours in advance of the deadline to double-check that you have submitted correctly.

If your submission does not compile you will receive a 0 for this assignment.
